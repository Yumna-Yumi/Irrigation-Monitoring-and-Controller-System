# Irrigation-Monitoring-and-Controller-System
This project is a beginner-friendly, smart irrigation solution designed to optimize water usage for plants and crops. By integrating an Arduino microcontroller with soil moisture sensors and a relay-controlled water pump, it automates irrigation based on real-time soil conditions. The system activates only when moisture levels drop below a user-defined threshold, ensuring plants stay perfectly hydrated—avoiding both overwatering and underwatering—while promoting sustainability and healthy growth. Ideal for hobbyists and gardeners, this repository provides everything you need to build an efficient, eco-conscious irrigation controller.
