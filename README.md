# Irrigation-Monitoring-and-Controller-System
This project is a beginner-friendly, smart irrigation solution designed to optimize water usage for plants and crops. By integrating an Arduino microcontroller with soil moisture sensors and a relay-controlled water pump, it automates irrigation based on real-time soil conditions. The system activates only when moisture levels drop below a user-defined threshold, ensuring plants stay perfectly hydrated—avoiding both overwatering and underwatering—while promoting sustainability and healthy growth. 
# Features
-Real-time soil moisture monitoring with easy-to-use sensors.
-Automatic pump activation based on a set moisture threshold.
-Prevents overwatering and underwatering for optimal plant health.
